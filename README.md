## BizzomateFormGroup
Use this widget to create form groups that look just like the default ones from Mendix, but with custom content.

## Features
- Add completely custom content somewhere in a form, but make it look like a form element
- Catch and display validation feedback of any attribute/assocation, without having to add an input element

## Usage
- Add to the page
- Configure label (yes/no, content)
- Configure if and what validation feedback needs to be shown
- Enjoy your added Mendix powers!
